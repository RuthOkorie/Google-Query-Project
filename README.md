### Features

- Data Filtering: This involves selecting a subset of data based on specific criteria. For example, you might want to view only sales data for a certain year or customers in a specific region. Filtering helps narrow down large datasets to focus on relevant information.

- Data Sorting: Sorting arranges data in a particular order, usually ascending or descending. For instance, you can sort customer data by name alphabetically or sort transactions by date. Sorting makes it easier to analyze and find patterns within the data.


Data Aggregation: Utilize functions like SUM, COUNT, MAX, MIN, and AVG within queries to perform data aggregation.

Logical Operations: Apply AND, OR, and LIKE operations to create complex conditions.

Data Transformation: Transform data by combining columns or extracting subsets based on criteria.
