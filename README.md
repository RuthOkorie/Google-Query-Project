### Features

- Data Filtering: This involves selecting a subset of data based on specific criteria. For example, you might want to view only sales data for a certain year or customers in a specific region. Filtering helps narrow down large datasets to focus on relevant information.

- Data Sorting: Sorting arranges data in a particular order, usually ascending or descending. For instance, you can sort customer data by name alphabetically or sort transactions by date. Sorting makes it easier to analyze and find patterns within the data.
  
- Data Aggregation: Aggregation combines multiple rows of data into summary values. Common aggregations include sums, averages, counts, minimum, and maximum values. For example, you could aggregate sales data to find the total revenue per month, which simplifies large datasets into meaningful insights.
  
- Logical Operations: Logical operations use conditions to compare values and return results based on true or false outcomes. Common logical operators include AND, OR, and NOT. For instance, you might use logical operations to filter data where both sales exceed $2,000 and the customer is in a specific region.
  
- Data Transformation: Data transformation modifies data into a new format or structure. This might involve converting data types, normalizing (scaling) values, or changing the layout. Transformation is essential when preparing data for analysis, as it ensures that data is consistent and ready for further processing
